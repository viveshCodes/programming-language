"""
Augmented assignment operators are a shorthand way to perform a binary operation and assign the result back to one of the operands.

Examples of augmented assignment operators in Python are:
    - Addition (+=): x += y is equivalent to x = x + y
    - Subtraction (-=): x -= y is equivalent to x = x - y
    - Multiplication (*=): x *= y is equivalent to x = x * y
    - Division (/=): x /= y is equivalent to x = x / y
    - Modulus (%=): x %= y is equivalent to x = x % y
